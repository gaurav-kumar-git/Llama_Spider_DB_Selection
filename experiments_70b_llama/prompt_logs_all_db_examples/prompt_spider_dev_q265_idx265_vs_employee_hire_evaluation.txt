You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table employee, columns = [ employee.Employee_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), employee.Name ( text | values: George Chuter, Lee Mears ), employee.Age ( real | values: 23, 29 ), employee.City ( text | values: Bristol, Bath ) ]
table shop, columns = [ shop.Shop_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), shop.Name ( text | values: FC Haka, HJK ), shop.Location ( text | values: Valkeakoski, Helsinki ), shop.District ( text | values: Tehtaan kenttä, Finnair Stadium ), shop.Number_products ( real | values: 3516, 10770 ), shop.Manager_name ( text | values: Olli Huttunen, Antti Muurinen ) ]
