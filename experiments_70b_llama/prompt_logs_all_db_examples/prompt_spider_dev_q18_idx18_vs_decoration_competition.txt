You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table college, columns = [ college.College_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), college.Name ( text | values: Saskatchewan School, B.C. School ), college.Leader_Name ( text | values: Ousame Tounkara, Ryan Thelwell ), college.College_Location ( text | values: Ottawa, Minnesota ) ]
table member, columns = [ member.Member_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), member.Name ( text | values: Jack Nicklaus, Billy Casper ), member.Country ( text | values: United States, Canada ), member.College_ID ( integer | values: 1, 4 ) ]
table round, columns = [ round.Round_ID ( real | values: 1, 2 ), round.Member_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), round.Decoration_Theme ( text | values: Walk on the Moon, Soft Dream ), round.Rank_in_Round ( real | values: 1, 2 ) ]
foreign keys:
member.College_ID = college.College_ID
round.Member_ID = member.Member_ID
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many members are there?
--List the names of members in ascending alphabetical order.
--What are the names and countries of members?
