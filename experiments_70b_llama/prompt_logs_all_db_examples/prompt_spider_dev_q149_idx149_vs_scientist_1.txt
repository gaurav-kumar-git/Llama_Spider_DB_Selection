You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table Scientists, columns = [ Scientists.SSN ( integer | primary key | values: 123234877, 152934485 ), Scientists.Name ( text | values: Michael Rogers, Anand Manikutty ) ]
table Projects, columns = [ Projects.Code ( text | primary key | values: AeH1, AeH2 ), Projects.Name ( text | values: Winds: Studying Bernoullis Principle, Aerodynamics and Bridge Design ), Projects.Hours ( real | values: 156, 189 ) ]
table AssignedTo, columns = [ AssignedTo.Scientist ( integer | primary key | values: 123234877, 152934485 ), AssignedTo.Project ( text | values: AeH1, AeH3 ) ]
foreign keys:
AssignedTo.Project = Projects.Code
AssignedTo.Scientist = Scientists.SSN
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--Find the total number of scientists.
--How many scientists are there?
--Find the total hours of all projects.
--What is the total number of hours for all projects?
--How many different scientists are assigned to any project?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
