You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table ACCOUNTS, columns = [ ACCOUNTS.custid ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), ACCOUNTS.name ( text | values: Brown, Wang ) ]
table SAVINGS, columns = [ SAVINGS.custid ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), SAVINGS.balance ( real | values: 200000.0, 999999999.0 ) ]
table CHECKING, columns = [ CHECKING.custid ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), CHECKING.balance ( real | values: 10000.0, 2000.0 ) ]
foreign keys:
SAVINGS.custid = ACCOUNTS.custid
CHECKING.custid = ACCOUNTS.custid
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--Find the total savings balance of all accounts except the account with name ‘Brown’.
--What is the total balance of savings accounts not belonging to someone with the name Brown?
--How many accounts are there in total?
--Count the number of accounts.
--What is the total checking balance in all accounts?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
