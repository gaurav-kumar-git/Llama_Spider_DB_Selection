Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Task: Can the question be answered using the schema? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# Now, evaluate the following:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE shop (
  Shop_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Address TEXT,
  Num_of_staff TEXT,
  Score REAL,
  Open_Year TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE member (
  Member_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Membership_card TEXT,
  Age REAL,
  Time_of_purchase REAL,
  Level_of_membership REAL,
  Address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE happy_hour (
  HH_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Shop_ID INTEGER,
  Month TEXT,
  Num_of_shaff_in_charge REAL,
  FOREIGN KEY (Shop_ID) REFERENCES shop (Shop_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE happy_hour_member (
  HH_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Member_ID INTEGER,
  Total_amount REAL,
  FOREIGN KEY (Member_ID) REFERENCES member (Member_ID)
);
]
