The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
