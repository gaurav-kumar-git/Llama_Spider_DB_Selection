Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Task: Can the question be answered using the schema? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# Now, evaluate the following:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE station (
  Station_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Annual_entry_exit REAL,
  Annual_interchanges REAL,
  Total_Passengers REAL,
  Location TEXT,
  Main_Services TEXT,
  Number_of_Platforms REAL
);

CREATE TABLE train (
  Train_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Time TEXT,
  Service TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE train_station (
  Train_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Station_ID INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (Station_ID) REFERENCES station (Station_ID),
  FOREIGN KEY (Train_ID) REFERENCES train (Train_ID)
);
]
