You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table architect, columns = [ architect.id ( text | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), architect.name ( text | values: Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry ), architect.nationality ( text | values: American, Canadian ), architect.gender ( text | values: male, female ) ]
table bridge, columns = [ bridge.architect_id ( integer | values: 1, 2 ), bridge.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), bridge.name ( text | values: Xian Ren Qiao (Fairy Bridge), Landscape Arch ), bridge.location ( text | values: Guangxi , China, Arches National Park , Utah , USA ), bridge.length_meters ( real | values: 121.0, 88.0 ), bridge.length_feet ( real | values: 400.0, 290.0 ) ]
table mill, columns = [ mill.architect_id ( integer | values: 1, 2 ), mill.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), mill.location ( text | values: Coswarem, Donceel ), mill.name ( text | values: Le Vieux Molen, Moulin Bertrand ), mill.type ( text | values: Grondzeiler, Bergmolen ), mill.built_year ( real | values: 1840, 1890 ), mill.notes ( text | values: Molenechos (Dutch) ) ]
foreign keys:
bridge.architect_id = architect.id
mill.architect_id = architect.id
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many architects are female?
--List the name, nationality and id of all male architects ordered by their names lexicographically.
--What is the maximum length in meters for the bridges and what are the architects' names?
--What is the average length in feet of the bridges?
--What are the names and year of construction for the mills of 'Grondzeiler' type?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
