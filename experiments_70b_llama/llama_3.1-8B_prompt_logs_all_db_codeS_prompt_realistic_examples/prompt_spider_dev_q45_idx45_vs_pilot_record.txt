You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table aircraft, columns = [ aircraft.Aircraft_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), aircraft.Order_Year ( real | values: 1992, 1996 ), aircraft.Manufacturer ( text | values: Gillig, NFI ), aircraft.Model ( text | values: Phantom (High Floor), Advantage (Low Floor) ), aircraft.Fleet_Series ( text | values: 444-464 (21), 465-467 (3) ), aircraft.Powertrain ( text | values: DD S50EGR Allison WB-400R, DD S50 Allison WB-400R ), aircraft.Fuel_Propulsion ( text | values: Diesel, Hybrid ) ]
table pilot, columns = [ pilot.Pilot_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), pilot.Pilot_name ( text | values: Patrick O'Bryant, Jermaine O'Neal ), pilot.Rank ( real | values: 13, 6 ), pilot.Age ( real | values: 33, 40 ), pilot.Nationality ( text | values: United States, United Kindom ), pilot.Position ( text | values: Center Team, Forward-Center Team ), pilot.Join_Year ( real | values: 2009, 2008 ), pilot.Team ( text | values: Bradley, Eau Claire High School ) ]
table pilot_record, columns = [ pilot_record.Record_ID ( real | values: 1, 2 ), pilot_record.Pilot_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), pilot_record.Aircraft_ID ( integer | values: 1, 4 ), pilot_record.Date ( text | values: 2003/01/04, 2005/01/04 ) ]
foreign keys:
pilot_record.Aircraft_ID = aircraft.Aircraft_ID
pilot_record.Pilot_ID = pilot.Pilot_ID

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many pilots are there?
--List the names of pilots in ascending order of rank.
--What are the positions and teams of pilots?
--List the distinct positions of pilots older than 30.
--Show the names of pilots from team "Bradley" or "Fordham".

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
Q: Give the flight numbers of flights leaving from APG.
