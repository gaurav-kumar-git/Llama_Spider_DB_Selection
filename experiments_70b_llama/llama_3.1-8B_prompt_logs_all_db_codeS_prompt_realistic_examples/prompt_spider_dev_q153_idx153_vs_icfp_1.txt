You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table Inst, columns = [ Inst.instID ( integer | primary key | values: 1000, 1010 ), Inst.name ( text | values: University of Oxford, Northeastern University ), Inst.country ( text | values: UK, USA ) ]
table Authors, columns = [ Authors.authID ( integer | primary key | values: 50, 51 ), Authors.lname ( text | values: Gibbons, Hinze ), Authors.fname ( text | values: Jeremy, Ralf ) ]

foreign keys:
Authorship.paperID = Papers.paperID
