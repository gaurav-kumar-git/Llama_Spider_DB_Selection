You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE medicine (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  Trade_Name TEXT,
  FDA_approved TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE enzyme (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  Location TEXT,
  Product TEXT,
  Chromosome TEXT,
  OMIM REAL,
  Porphyria TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE medicine_enzyme_interaction (
  enzyme_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  medicine_id INTEGER,
  interaction_type TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (medicine_id) REFERENCES medicine(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (enzyme_id) REFERENCES enzyme(id)
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many kinds of enzymes are there?
--What is the total count of enzymes?
--List the name of enzymes in descending lexicographical order.
--What are the names of enzymes in descending order?
--List the names and the locations that the enzymes can make an effect.

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
