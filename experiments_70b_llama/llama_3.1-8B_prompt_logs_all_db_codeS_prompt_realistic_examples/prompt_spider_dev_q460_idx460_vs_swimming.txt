You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many events are there?
--List all the event names by year from the most recent to the oldest.
--What is the name of the event that happened in the most recent year?
--How many stadiums are there?
--Find the name of the stadium that has the maximum capacity.
