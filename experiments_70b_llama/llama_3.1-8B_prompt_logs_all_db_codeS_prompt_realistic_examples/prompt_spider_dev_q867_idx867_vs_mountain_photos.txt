You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table mountain, columns = [ mountain.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), mountain.name ( text | values: Abune Yosef / Guliba Amba, Ioll / Yoll ), mountain.Height ( real | values: 4260.0, 4220.0 ), mountain.Prominence ( real | values: 1909.0, 350.0 ), mountain.Range ( text | values: Lasta Massif, Kollo Massif ), mountain.Country ( text | values: Ethiopia, Morocco ) ]
table camera_lens, columns = [ camera_lens.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), camera_lens.brand ( text | values: Olympus, Panasonic ), camera_lens.name ( text | values: Olympus 15mm f/8.0 Body Cap, Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 ), camera_lens.focal_length_mm ( real | values: 15.0, 45.0 ), camera_lens.max_aperture ( real | values: 8.0, 1.8 ) ]
table photos, columns = [ photos.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), photos.camera_lens_id ( integer | values: 1, 10 ), photos.mountain_id ( integer | values: 20, 2 ), photos.color ( text | values: RBG, Black/White ), photos.name ( text | values: monkey, rabbits ) ]
foreign keys:
photos.mountain_id = mountain.id
photos.camera_lens_id = camera_lens.id
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many camera lenses have a focal length longer than 15 mm?
--Find the brand and name for each camera lens, and sort in descending order of maximum aperture.
--List the id, color scheme, and name for all the photos.
--What are the maximum and average height of the mountains?
--What are the average prominence of the mountains in country 'Morocco'?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
