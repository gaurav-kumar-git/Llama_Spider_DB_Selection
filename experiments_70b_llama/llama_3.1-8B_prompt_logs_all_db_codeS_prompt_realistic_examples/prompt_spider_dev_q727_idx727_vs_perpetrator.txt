You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table perpetrator, columns = [ perpetrator.Perpetrator_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), perpetrator.People_ID ( integer | values: 1, 3 ), perpetrator.Date ( text | values: 04.26 April 26/27, 11.18 Nov. 18 ), perpetrator.Year ( real | values: 1982.0, 1995.0 ), perpetrator.Location ( text | values: Uiryeong, Zhaodong ), perpetrator.Country ( text | values: South Korea, China ), perpetrator.Killed ( real | values: 56, 32 ), perpetrator.Injured ( real | values: 37, 16 ) ]
