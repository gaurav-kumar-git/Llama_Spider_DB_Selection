You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table medicine, columns = [ medicine.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), medicine.name ( text | values: Amisulpride, Aripiprazole ), medicine.Trade_Name ( text | values: Solian, Abilify ), medicine.FDA_approved ( text | values: No, Yes ) ]
table enzyme, columns = [ enzyme.id ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), enzyme.name ( text | values: ALA synthase, ALA dehydratase ), enzyme.Location ( text | values: Mitochondrion, Cytosol ), enzyme.Product ( text | values: Î´-Aminolevulinic acid, Porphobilinogen ), enzyme.Chromosome ( text | values: 3p21.1, 9q34 ), enzyme.OMIM ( real | values: 125290, 125270 ), enzyme.Porphyria ( text | values: none, ALA-Dehydratase deficiency ) ]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many kinds of enzymes are there?
--What is the total count of enzymes?
--List the name of enzymes in descending lexicographical order.
--What are the names of enzymes in descending order?
--List the names and the locations that the enzymes can make an effect.
