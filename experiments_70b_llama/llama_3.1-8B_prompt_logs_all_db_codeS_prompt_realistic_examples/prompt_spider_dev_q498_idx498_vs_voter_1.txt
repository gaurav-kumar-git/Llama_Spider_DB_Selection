You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table AREA_CODE_STATE, columns = [ AREA_CODE_STATE.area_code ( integer | primary key | values: 201, 202 ), AREA_CODE_STATE.state ( text | values: NJ, DC ) ]
table CONTESTANTS, columns = [ CONTESTANTS.contestant_number ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), CONTESTANTS.contestant_name ( text | values: Edwina Burnam, Tabatha Gehling ) ]

foreign keys:
VOTES.contestant_number = CONTESTANTS.contestant_number
VOTES.state = AREA_CODE_STATE.state
