You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table Student, columns = [ Student.StuID ( integer | primary key | values: 1001, 1002 ), Student.LName ( text | values: Smith, Kim ), Student.Fname ( text | values: Linda, Tracy ), Student.Age ( real | values: 18, 19 ), Student.Sex ( text | values: F, M ), Student.Major ( real | values: 600, 520 ), Student.Advisor ( real | values: 1121, 7712 ), Student.city_code ( text | values: BAL, HKG ) ]
table Has_Pet, columns = [ Has_Pet.StuID ( integer | values: 1001, 1002 ), Has_Pet.PetID ( integer | values: 2001, 2002 ) ]
table Pets, columns = [ Pets.PetID ( integer | primary key | values: 2001, 2002 ), Pets.PetType ( text | values: cat, dog ), Pets.pet_age ( real | values: 3, 2 ), Pets.weight ( real | values: 12.0, 13.4 ) ]
foreign keys:
Has_Pet.StuID = Student.StuID
Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
