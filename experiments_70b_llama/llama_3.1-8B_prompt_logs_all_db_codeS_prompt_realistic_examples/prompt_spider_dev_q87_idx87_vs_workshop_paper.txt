You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table workshop, columns = [ workshop.Workshop_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), workshop.Date ( text | values: August 18, 2007, August 21, 2007 ), workshop.Venue ( text | values: London UK, New Jersey USA ), workshop.Name ( text | values: ABC 2007, Conference 2007 ) ]

table Acceptance, columns = [ Acceptance.Submission_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), Acceptance.Workshop_ID ( integer | values: 1, 3 ), Acceptance.Result ( text | values: Accepted, Rejected ) ]
foreign keys:
Acceptance.Workshop_ID = workshop.Workshop_ID
Acceptance.Submission_ID = submission.Submission_ID
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many submissions are there?
