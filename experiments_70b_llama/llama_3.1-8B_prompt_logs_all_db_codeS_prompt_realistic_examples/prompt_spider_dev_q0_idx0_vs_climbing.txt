The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE mountain (
  Mountain_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,

);

CREATE TABLE climber (
  Climber_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Country TEXT,
  Time TEXT,
  Points REAL,
  Mountain_ID INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (Mountain_ID) REFERENCES mountain(Mountain_ID)
);
