You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table course, columns = [ course.Course_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), course.Staring_Date ( text | values: 5 May, 6 May ), course.Course ( text | values: Language Arts, Math ) ]
table teacher, columns = [ teacher.Teacher_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), teacher.Name ( text | values: Joseph Huts, Gustaaf Deloor ), teacher.Age ( text | values: 32, 29 ), teacher.Hometown ( text | values: Blackrod Urban District, Bolton County Borough ) ]
table course_arrange, columns = [ course_arrange.Course_ID ( integer | primary key | values: 2, 3 ), course_arrange.Teacher_ID ( integer | values: 5, 3 ), course_arrange.Grade ( real | values: 1, 3 ) ]
foreign keys:
course_arrange.Teacher_ID = teacher.Teacher_ID
course_arrange.Course_ID = course.Course_ID
]
