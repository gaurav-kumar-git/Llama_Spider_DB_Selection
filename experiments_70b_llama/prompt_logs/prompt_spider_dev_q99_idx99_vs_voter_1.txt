You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
table AREA_CODE_STATE, columns = [ AREA_CODE_STATE.area_code ( integer | primary key | values: 201, 202 ), AREA_CODE_STATE.state ( text | values: NJ, DC ) ]
table CONTESTANTS, columns = [ CONTESTANTS.contestant_number ( integer | primary key | values: 1, 2 ), CONTESTANTS.contestant_name ( text | values: Edwina Burnam, Tabatha Gehling ) ]
table VOTES, columns = [ VOTES.vote_id ( integer | primary key | values: 5, 3 ), VOTES.phone_number ( real | values: 5112677315, 6209222712 ), VOTES.state ( text | values: NY, CA ), VOTES.contestant_number ( integer | values: 2, 3 ), VOTES.created ( datetime | values: 2018-03-09 19:03:21, 2018-03-09 19:03:36 ) ]
foreign keys:
VOTES.contestant_number = CONTESTANTS.contestant_number
VOTES.state = AREA_CODE_STATE.state
