You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE Student (
  StuID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  LName TEXT,
  Fname TEXT,
  Age REAL,
  Sex TEXT,
  Major REAL,
  Advisor REAL,
  city_code TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Has_Pet (
  StuID INTEGER,
  PetID INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (StuID) REFERENCES Student(StuID),
  FOREIGN KEY (PetID) REFERENCES Pets(PetID)
);

CREATE TABLE Pets (
  PetID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  PetType TEXT,
  pet_age REAL,
  weight REAL
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--Find the number of pets whose weight is heavier than 10.
--How many pets have a greater weight than 10?
--Find the weight of the youngest dog.
--How much does the youngest dog weigh?
--Find the maximum weight for each type of pet. List the maximum weight and pet type.
