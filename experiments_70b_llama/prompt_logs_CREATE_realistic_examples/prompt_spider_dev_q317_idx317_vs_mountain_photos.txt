You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE mountain (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  Height REAL,
  Prominence REAL,
  Range TEXT,
  Country TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE camera_lens (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  brand TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  focal_length_mm REAL,
  max_aperture REAL
);

CREATE TABLE photos (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  camera_lens_id INTEGER,
  mountain_id INTEGER,
  color TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (mountain_id) REFERENCES mountain(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (camera_lens_id) REFERENCES camera_lens(id)
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many camera lenses have a focal length longer than 15 mm?
--Find the brand and name for each camera lens, and sort in descending order of maximum aperture.
--List the id, color scheme, and name for all the photos.
--What are the maximum and average height of the mountains?
--What are the average prominence of the mountains in country 'Morocco'?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
