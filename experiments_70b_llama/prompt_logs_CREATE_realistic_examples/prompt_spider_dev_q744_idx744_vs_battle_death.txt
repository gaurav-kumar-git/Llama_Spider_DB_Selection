You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE battle (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  date TEXT,
  bulgarian_commander TEXT,
  latin_commander TEXT,
  result TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE ship (
  lost_in_battle INTEGER,
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  tonnage TEXT,
  ship_type TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  disposition_of_ship TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (lost_in_battle) REFERENCES battle(id)
);

CREATE TABLE death (
  caused_by_ship_id INTEGER,
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  note TEXT,
  killed REAL,
  injured REAL,
  FOREIGN KEY (caused_by_ship_id) REFERENCES ship(id)
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many ships ended up being 'Captured'?
--List the name and tonnage ordered by in descending alphaetical order for the names.
--List the name, date and result of each battle.
--What is maximum and minimum death toll caused each time?
--What is the average number of injuries caused each time?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
