You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE race (
  Race_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Class TEXT,
  Date TEXT,
  Track_ID TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (Track_ID) REFERENCES track(Track_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE track (
  Track_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,
  Location TEXT,
  Seating REAL,
  Year_Opened REAL
);
]
