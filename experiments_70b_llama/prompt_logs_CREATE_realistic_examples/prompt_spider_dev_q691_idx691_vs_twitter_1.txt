You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE follows (
  f1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  f2 INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (f2) REFERENCES user_profiles(uid),
  FOREIGN KEY (f1) REFERENCES user_profiles(uid)
);

CREATE TABLE tweets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  uid INTEGER,
  text TEXT,
  createdate DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (uid) REFERENCES user_profiles(uid)
);

CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  uid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  partitionid REAL,
  followers REAL
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--Find the emails of the user named "Mary".
--What is the partition id of the user named "Iron Man".
--How many users are there?
--How many followers does each user have?
--Find the number of followers for each user.

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
