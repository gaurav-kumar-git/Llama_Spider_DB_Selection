You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE department (
  Department_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name TEXT,

  Ranking REAL,
  Budget_in_Billions REAL,
  Num_Employees REAL
);

CREATE TABLE head (
  head_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,

  head_ID INTEGER,
  temporary_acting TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (head_ID) REFERENCES head(head_ID),
  FOREIGN KEY (department_ID) REFERENCES department(Department_ID)
);
]
