You are an expert system that determines if a natural language question can be answered using ONLY the provided database schema.
The schema includes sample values for some columns; treat these as HINTS to understand the column's content, not as a complete list.
Your task is to respond with a single character: '1' if the question is answerable, or '0' if it is not.
Do not provide any explanations or other text. Just '1' or '0'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Few-Shot Examples:

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE student (student_id INT, student_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE course (course_id INT, course_name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (student_id INT, course_id INT);
]
Q: List the names of all students enrolled in the 'Math' course.
A: 1

[Schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount REAL);
CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT, customer_name TEXT);
]
Q: Find the total number of orders placed in 2019.
A: 0

# You are provided with a database schema.
[Schema:
CREATE TABLE airport (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  City TEXT,
  Country TEXT,
  IATA TEXT,
  ICAO TEXT,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE operate_company (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  Type TEXT,
  Principal_activities TEXT,
  Incorporated_in TEXT,
  Group_Equity_Shareholding REAL
);

CREATE TABLE flight (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Vehicle_Flight_number TEXT,
  Date TEXT,
  Pilot TEXT,
  Velocity REAL,
  Altitude REAL,
  airport_id INTEGER,
  company_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES operate_company(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (airport_id) REFERENCES airport(id)
);
]

#Here are some example questions that CAN be answered by the schema above:
--How many flights have a velocity larger than 200?
--List the vehicle flight number, date and pilot of all the flights, ordered by altitude.
--List the id, country, city and name of the airports ordered alphabetically by the name.
--What is maximum group equity shareholding of the companies?
--What is the velocity of the pilot named 'Thompson'?

# Task: Can the following question be answered using ONLY the schema above? Respond with 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
Q: Return the first name, last name and email of the owners living in a state whose name contains the substring 'North'.
